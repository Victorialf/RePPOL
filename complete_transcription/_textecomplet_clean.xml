 Upon this text, you must pray w<expan>ith</expan>out int<expan>er</expan>mission, he said
 Som felowes say <expan>that</expan> this is impossible, but I shal tel you

 in <expan>the</expan> lawe. That <expan>that</expan> a man doth by his <expan>pro</expan>ctor, he doth
 it by hy<expan>m</expan>selfe. Wherfore whan thou art in <expan>the</expan> felde at

 thou co<expan>n</expan>tinually pray.

 he prayeth, as saynt Paule saith. Nescit ho<expan>mo</expan> quom<expan>odo</expan> ora<expan>n</expan>du<expan>m</expan>
