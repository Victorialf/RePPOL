Edmond Schethers answer ot the 13 Articles To the first : I know not the begynn<expan>er</expan>s of thes matters at london but I think t<expan>hat</expan> Mr serles talked w<expan>ith</expan> doctor london of them as he cam from cant<expan>er</expan> to oxxon And I think also t<expan>hat</expan> Mr Williby moved such matt<expan>er</expan>s much ther by reson he said <expan>that</expan> (1) he had spoken w<expan>ith </expan>many of the kinges cownsell in it &amp; that he wold take upon him to be the hole setter forth of the matter. After the woordes Mr baker did  send for Mr p<expan>ar</expan>khurst Mr garden<expan>er</expan> &amp; me.  I know none that gave cownsell ther but I think that Mr williby did much of his own hedde I know not who cousend ther in the matter other wise then as I have said that Mr baker shewd us the book the which my lord of wynchester rede &amp; doctor london (2) took the names of the witnes of the same I know no grownd thei hadd but I think t<expan>hat </expan>the coming of S<expan>ir</expan> t<expan>ur</expan>ner &amp; S<expan>ir </expan>anthony p<expan>ar</expan>son &amp; other owt of other dioces in to this: And the resort that was so fare of : to Sir t<expan>ur</expan>ners s<expan>er</expan>mons: And the subscribing of Sir bland to his articles as it  is said: And the reding of sur anthony p<expan>ar</expan>son of the bible &amp; other with adding ther expositions to the same was a gret occasion of it I know not who declared ony grownd ther but I think Mr williby shewd the book &amp; moved the mat<expan>ter</expan> much ther I know no matters ony in london knoweth my lordes grace culpable in but  in such articles as mast<expan>er</expan> baker willed us to say what we hard we did  I know not the begynner of it in canter but I suspect Mr coxston &amp; Mr gardener by  reyso that coxston did use to write all such matters And many articles of the  book wer known only to Mr gardener. As for other matt<expan>er</expan>s the fame was grete I know none t<expan>hat</expan> the p<expan>ro</expan>moter but Mr garden<expan>er</expan> &amp; williby as towching the books before such tyme that it was subscribed then the witnes wer all of cownsell t<expan>hat</expan> Mr williby hadd the book (3) Mr garden<expan>er</expan> &amp; williby conferd to gither befor Mr williby receved the book &amp; after  such as subscribe talked of the articles sometyme &amp; of other articles as we hard them spoken I know no grownd but I thinke as I have said in the 4 article above and also bicause the prorses aganst Mr rydley &amp; scory went not forth as against  Mr serles &amp; me: Also bycause Joan barnes, gilles barran, bukn<expan>er</expan> (?) &amp; other of when much talking was of, wer not poonisshed &amp; other matt<expan>er</expan>s w<expan>hich</expan> I remember not t<expan>hat</expan> men said wer much borne I do not know what knowledge other men hadd I have hard men say many thinges as that my lord did nkow of bukn<expan>er</expan>s opynion of Joan barnes opynion: that gilles of barran used the office of a prest being no prest &amp; other thinges w<expan>hich</expan> were not reformed but thes thinges manye wer done before I cam in to thes p<expan>ar</expan>tes &amp; whrin he my lordes grace is culpable it is not in  me to say nor I know not what other do know my lord to be culpable in          (1) Dr Willoughby (2) Mr Baker  wintomen D. london (3) Gardin<expan>er</expan>  willoughby  articles are numbered 1 to 6 and starting line 21, again numbered 1 to 6

8. the last tyme I was at london with Mr baker he hadd me go and se a book of articles that I went to Mr moyle hadd &amp; to show him also as to doctor london the article of sir bland quod missa non est sacrifitium pro peccatis And when I shewd Mr moile the said article he said : alas is then mor articles yet agaynst  him he hath to many all redy And by reson it was then night I d(id) only drink with him &amp; he said he wolde helpe to a q<expan>ui</expan>etnes asmuch as in h(im?) lay in thes matters &amp; so I de<expan>par</expan>ted frome hym. Also mr garden<expan>er</expan> shewed me that  he hadd deliv<expan>er</expan>d certayn articles to Mr thwattes to whome I sent at  doctor cokes coming by the advice of Mr garden<expan>er</expan> to have a bill w<expan>hich</expan> thei of s. georges hadd put up to him: to thintent it might be presented to do(ctor) cokes And he sent it me w<expan>ith</expan> mo billes w<expan>hich</expan> wer presented befor to the said doctor cokes. As for any communycation I nev<expan>er</expan> hard them say but that th(ey?) truste we shuld have a q<expan>ui</expan>tnes in opinions &amp; that all thing shuld be w(?) I know not with whome other have spoken in thes matters 9. I know not to whay thinges thei have conduced unto 10.

Also one night at Mr <expan>par</expan>khurstes at sup<expan>per</expan> talking of the sessions of the 6 articles he redd a form or copy of an endightment having no mans name nor I know not wh(en?) he red it but only to shew (as I think) a forme of such endightmentes a(s?) wer used at the 6 articles 11. I know no man that ever entended ony other thing then to have a un(ity?)  &amp; quietnes in opinions and all contention to cease 12. I can not say of other men but aft<expan>er</expan> that Mr baker willed me to note the che- fist berers &amp; authors of thes new opynions we thowght I could do no (-??) but write such thinges as I harde And therfor I can say little in this  matter but as I se my writing to put in me in remembrans.  Whether I spake of ony such thinge at charing I can not tell byt I remember that at Mr parkurstes table in canter as one spake of preaching in thanet (I said)  (as it is trew in dede) that I was never ther syns I cam in to kent: but  bicause I hard the cowntrey so gretly commended I said I longged to goe thither: upon which woordes Mr mylles (I think) said whi let us: Mr garde(ner) I, mr serles and yow go thither one day And bicause ther be viii churches (-?) us prech 2 sermons a peice &amp; so in all the churches in one day And afte(r) we will make myrry ther a bowt a day or 2 &amp; come home agayn her is all the intent &amp; prorses I know was hadd in the same not I nev<expan>er</expan> hard mor of it.
