				<p xml:lang="fr">Notre projet est consacré à la transcription, l’édition critique et
					l’analyse d’un document exceptionnel : le manuscrit MS 128 conservé à la
					bibliothèque de Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (à voir sur la <ref target="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/project/31">plateforme TACT</ref>). Il
					s’agit d’un manuscrit composite d’environ 220 folios qui contient la
					documentation rassemblée en 1543 sous l’égide de l’Archevêque de Cantorbéry,
					Thomas Cranmer. Celui-ci, gagné aux idées réformées, est visé par un complot
					ourdi par des chanoines de sa propre cathédrale (d’où le surnom de Prebendaries
					Plot) en lien avec des prêtres et des laïcs « conservateurs » du diocèse du
					Kent. Ces derniers initient un travail de collecte de dénonciations attestant de
					la radicalité religieuse de Cranmer et de certains de ses clients réformés afin
					de discréditer l’archevêque de Cantorbéry aux yeux du roi et précipiter sa
					chute. Cependant, le roi maintient sa faveur à Cranmer mais le charge d’enquêter
					sur toutes les croyances ou pratiques non conformistes dans son diocèse.
					L’objectif de cette vaste enquête est encore à élucider. L’archevêque semble
					saisir cette occasion pour incriminer les clercs et les laïcs conservateurs qui
					ont participé au Prebendaries Plot : ses agents collectent dénonciations et
					témoignages de croyances ou pratiques « superstitieuses » ou « papistes » ;
					mais, le manuscrit renferme également des dénonciations de sacramentaires,
					d’iconoclastes et d’évangéliques radicaux, qui auraient davantage pu susciter
					l’indulgence de Cranmer.</p>
				<p xml:lang="fr">Dès lors, le manuscrit MS 128, fruits de ces collectes
					antinomiques, est une mosaïque double. Mosaïque de documents d’abord, puisqu’il
					comporte des lettres de dénonciations, des interrogatoires ou encore des
					mémorandums dont le sens nous échappe en partie ; mais il est aussi une mosaïque
					de traces des croyances et des pratiques religieuses dans un comté anglais des
					années 1540. En effet, il renferme plus d’une centaine de témoignages ou
					dénonciations émanant de clercs et de laïcs des deux sexes et de tout rang.
					Cette documentation fragmentée révèle l’éclectisme des croyances et des
					pratiques dans cette Angleterre qui a rompu avec Rome depuis près de dix ans et
					dans laquelle Henri VIII peine à imposer une quelconque uniformité malgré
					l’instauration de la Suprématie royale. Ce manuscrit serait-il la trace
					archivistique des tentatives royales (et de leurs limites) d’imposer une «
					uniformité religieuse » désirée par Henri VIII depuis le début des années 1530
					?</p>
				<p xml:lang="fr">Jusqu’à présent, plusieurs historiens ont mobilisé partiellement
					cette source dans le contexte d’études plus larges (Ethan Shagan afin d’explorer
					l’avancée de la Réforme en Angleterre, Diarmaid MacCulloch pour dresser les
					portraits des détracteurs de Thomas Cranmer dans la biographie qu’il lui
					consacre…), mais aucune étude du manuscrit per se n’a été menée et on ne l’a
					jamais fait dialoguer avec des documents proches (interrogatoires,
					dénonciations…) pour en dégager les éclairages politiques, religieux ou sociaux
					qu’il peut apporter sur la période.</p>
				<p xml:lang="fr">Or, le projet RePPOL entend montrer que cette source exceptionnelle
					permet non seulement d’éclairer les croyances et les pratiques liturgiques
					populaires souvent inattendues, parfois cocasses, dans un Kent en « transition
					confessionnelle », mais aussi de saisir la Réforme anglaise comme un phénomène
					de transformation anthropologique du rapport au religieux, processus qui s’étend
					sur des plusieurs décennies du XVIe siècle. RePPOL s’inscrit enfin dans le cadre
					des renouvellements historiographiques récents sur le rôle du peuple dans la
					production du politique à l’époque moderne, ces témoignages permettant de
					comprendre le rôle actif que les sujets, y compris les laïcs les plus infimes,
					ont pu jouer dans les processus de mutations politico-religieuses que connaît
					l’Angleterre henricienne.</p>

				<p>Adoptant une démarche de recherche collaborative et de formation par la
					recherche, ce projet s'articule en trois temps. La première étape (fin juin
					2021-début 2022) vise à transcrire l'intégralité du manuscrit, par une démarche
					collaborative mobilisant enseignants-chercheurs et étudiants dans le cadre du
					cours de paléographie moderne. La transcription semi-diplomatique est réalisé
					via la <ref target="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/">plateforme de Transcription et
						d'Annotations de Corpus Textuel (TACT)</ref> développée par l'Université de
					Grenoble. Les images des folios ont été numérisées par la <ref target="https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/ps908cx9813">Parker
						Library</ref> et y étaient accessibles selon le cadre interopérable <ref target="https://iiif.io/">International Image Interoperability Framework
							(3IF)</ref>. La seconde étape du travail (2022) est consacrée à l'analyse
					fine de cette source à la lumière de documents archivistiques de nature
					similaire. La troisième étape, dont le présent document est l'une des
					incarnations, est la constitution d'une édition numérique en ligne permettant
					via balisage en xml-tei l'interrogation du contenu du document par des
					index.</p>

				<p xml:lang="en">Our project is devoted to the transcription, critical edition, and
					analysis of an exceptional document: the manuscript MS 128 held in the library
					of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (can be viewed on the <ref target="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/project/31">TACT platform</ref>). It is
					a composite manuscript of about 220 folios that contains the documentation
					gathered in 1543 under the supervision of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas
					Cranmer. The latter, won over to the Reformed ideas, was the target of a plot
					hatched by canons of his own cathedral (hence the nickname of the Prebendaries
					Plot) in connection with priests and "conservative" laymen of the diocese of
					Kent. The latter initiated a work of collecting denunciations attesting to the
					religious radicalism of Cranmer and some of his reformed clients in order to
					discredit the archbishop of Canterbury in the eyes of the king and precipitate
					his fall. However, the king maintained his favor to Cranmer but charged him with
					investigating all non-conformist beliefs or practices in his diocese. The
					purpose of this vast investigation is yet to be clarified. The archbishop seemed
					to take the opportunity to incriminate conservative clerics and laymen who had
					participated in the Prebendaries Plot: his agents collected denunciations and
					testimonies of "superstitious" or "papist" beliefs or practices; but the
					manuscript also contained denunciations of sacramentarians, iconoclasts and
					radical evangelicals, which might have been more likely to elicit Cranmer's
					leniency.</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">The manuscript MS 128, fruit of these antinomic collections, is a
					double mosaic. A mosaic of documents, since it contains letters of denunciation,
					interrogations and memoranda whose meaning partly escapes us; but it is also a
					mosaic of traces of religious beliefs and practices in an English county in the
					1540's. Indeed, it contains more than a hundred testimonies or denunciations
					emanating from clerics and laymen of both sexes and of all ranks. This
					fragmented documentation reveals the eclecticism of beliefs and practices in an
					England that broke with Rome nearly ten years ago and in which Henry VIII
					struggled to impose any kind of uniformity despite the establishment of the
					Royal Supremacy. Could this manuscript be the archival trace of the royal
					attempts (and their limits) to impose a "religious uniformity" desired by Henry
					VIII since the early 1530s ?</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Several historians have partially mobilized this source in the
					context of broader studies (Ethan Shagan in order to explore the progress of the
					Reformation in England, Diarmaid MacCulloch in order to draw up portraits of
					Thomas Cranmer's detractors in his biography of him... ), but no study of the
					manuscript per se has been carried out and it has never been put in dialogue
					with related documents (interrogations, denunciations...) in order to bring out
					the political, religious or social insights that it can bring to the period.</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">The RePPOL project intends to show that this exceptional source not
					only sheds light on the often unexpected, sometimes comical, popular beliefs and
					liturgical practices in a Kent undergoing a "confessional transition", but also
					to grasp the English Reformation as a phenomenon of anthropological
					transformation of the relationship to religion, a process that extends over
					several decades of the sixteenth century. Finally, RePPOL is part of the recent
					historiographic renewal on the role of the people in the production of politics
					in the modern era, as these testimonies allow us to understand the active role
					that subjects, including the most minute laymen, were able to play in the
					processes of political and religious mutations that Henrician England
					experienced.</p>
				<p xml:lang="en">Adopting a collaborative and training-through-research approach,
					this project is articulated in three stages. The first stage (end of June
					2021-beginning of 2022) aims to transcribe the entire manuscript, through a
					collaborative approach mobilizing teacher-researchers and students in the
					context of the modern paleography course. The semi-diplomatic transcription is
					carried out via the <ref target="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/">Transcription and
						Annotation Platform for Textual Corpus (TACT)</ref> developed by the
					University of Grenoble. The images of the folios were digitized by the <ref target="https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/ps908cx9813">Parker
						Library</ref> and were accessible there according to the <ref target="https://iiif.io/">International Image Interoperability Framework
							(3IF)</ref>. The second stage of the work (2022) is devoted to fine-grained
					analysis of this source in light of archival records of a similar nature. The
					third step, of which the present document is one of the incarnations, is the
					constitution of an online digital edition allowing via xml-tei tagging the
					interrogation of the document content by indexes.</p>

Also on trinite sonday was twelve monethes when many the

w<expan>ith</expan> hono<expan>ur</expan> is an ymage &amp; not an idole./.

Edmond Schethers answer ot the 13 Articles
To <expan>the</expan> first : I know not <expan>the</expan> begynn<expan>er</expan>s of thes matters at london but I think
$1$ t<expan>hat</expan> Mr serles talked w<expan>ith</expan> doctor london of them as he cam fro<expan>m</expan> cant<expan>erbury</expan> to oxon<expan>ford</expan> And
$D willoughby$ I think also t<expan>hat</expan> mr Williby moved such matt<expan>er</expan>s much ther by reson he said <expan>that</expan>
he had spoken w<expan>ith </expan>many of the king<expan>es</expan> cownsell in it &amp; that he wold take upon
him to be the hole sett<expan>er</expan> forth of <expan>the</expan> matt<expan>er</expan>. Aft<expan>er </expan>the w<expan>hich</expan> woordes Mr baker did 
send for mr p<expan>ar</expan>khurst mr garden<expan>er</expan> &amp; me. 
$2$ I know none <expan>that</expan> gave cownsell ther but I think <expan>that</expan> mr williby did much of his
own hedde.
$3$ I know not who consend ther in the matt<expan>er</expan> other wise then as I have said <expan>that</expan>
$Mr Baker vintomen D. london$ mr baker shewd us the book the which my lord of wy<expan>n</expan>chest<expan>er</expan> rede &amp; doctor lo<expan>n</expan>don
took the names of <expan>the</expan> witnes of the same.
I know no grownd thei hadd but I think t<expan>hat </expan>the co<expan>m</expan>mi<expan>n</expan>g of S<expan>ir</expan> t<expan>ur</expan>ner &amp; S<expan>ir </expan>a<expan>n</expan>thony
$4$ p<expan>ar</expan>son &amp; other owt of other dioces in to this. And the resort <expan>that</expan> was so fare
of : to Sir t<expan>ur</expan>ners s<expan>er</expan>mons: And the s<expan>u</expan>bscribing of Sir bland to his articles as it 
is said: And the redi<expan>n</expan>g of sir anthony p<expan>ar</expan>son of <expan>the</expan> bible &amp; other w<expan>ith</expan> addi<expan>n</expan>g ther
expositions to <expan>the</expan> same was a gret occasion of it/
$5$ I know not who declared any grownd ther but I think mr williby shewd
the book &amp; moved the mat<expan>ter</expan> much ther
$n 6$ I know no matters ony in london knoweth my lord<expan>es</expan> grace culpable in but 
in such articles as mast<expan>er</expan> baker willed us to say what we hard we did

$Coxson Gardin<expan>er</expan>$ I know not the begyn<expan>er</expan> of it in cant<expan>erbury</expan> but I suspect Mr coxston &amp; Mr garden<expan>er</expan> by 
$1$ reyso <expan>that</expan> coxston did use to write all such matt<expan>er</expan>s And many articles of the 
book wer known only to Mr gardener./. As for other matt<expan>er</expan>s the fame was grete
$2$ I know none t<expan>hat</expan> was the p<expan>ro</expan>moter but Mr garden<expan>er</expan> &amp; williby as towchi<expan>n</expan>g <expan>the</expan> booke
$Gardin<expan>er</expan> Willoughby$ befor such tyme that it was subscribed then the witnes wer all of cownsell.
t<expan>hat</expan> mr williby hadd the book
Mr garden<expan>er</expan> &amp; williby co<expan>n</expan>ferd to gither befor Mr williby receved the book &amp; after 
$3$ such as s<expan>u</expan>bscribed talked of the articles sometyme &amp; of other articles as we 
hard them spoken.
I know no grownd but I thinke as I have said in the 4 article above and
$4$ also bicause the <expan>pro</expan>rses aganst Mr rydley &amp; scory went not forth as against 
mr serles &amp; me: Also bycause Joan barnes, gilles barra<expan>m</expan>, bukm<expan>er</expan> &amp; o<expan>ther</expan> of whom
much talking was of: wer not poonisshed. &amp; other matt<expan>er</expan>s w<expan>hich</expan> I reme<expan>m</expan>ber not t<expan>hat</expan>
men said wer much borne
$5$ I do not know what knowledge other me<expan>n</expan> hadd.
$n$ I have hard me<expan>n</expan> say many thing<expan>es</expan> as that my lord did know of bukm<expan>er</expan>s opynio<expan>n</expan>
$6$ of Joan barnes opynio<expan>n</expan>: that gilles of barram used the office of a prest being no
prest &amp; other thing<expan>es</expan> w<expan>hich</expan> wer not reformed but thes thing<expan>es</expan> manye wer done befor
I cam in to thes p<expan>ar</expan>tes &amp; wherin <del rend="">he </del>my lord<expan>es</expan> grace is culpable it is not in 
me to say nor I know not what other do know my lord to be culpable in

$ff$. To the first article I say. that in the booke of complaint is one

To the second, witnes was brought in / but what was <expan>pro</expan>ved
I knowe not. 
To the thirde, I know not the cause, why iii articles
wer lefte out / nor I nev<expan>er </expan>herd the book thoroughly red.

Serlis for thies wourdes / <add place="">but </add>my lord said : that all
ymages wer Idolles. for the greke wourd idolu<expan>m</expan> and
ymago were all one.
To the vth. I say. that my lord said / that he had
put in three of the new lernyng / and iii of thold / and
declared the same to the kinges grace / who was pleased
therew<expan>ith</expan> all.

To the vii. I can say nothing, saving that I herd saye
I cannot tell of whome / that certaine of hothefild

offred them self<expan>es</expan> or of whome I <del rend="">offr </del>hard that any 
offred them self<expan>es</expan> I know not. 
To the viiith I know nothing
To the ix I hard no preaching of them but well, to my
Judgement. But Shether made a declaration to c<expan>er</expan>tain
articles. Whither they wer falcely surmised or no, I 
know not. / And by whome Serlis was co<expan>m</expan>mitted to prison
I know not / but that it was by the counsaill.
