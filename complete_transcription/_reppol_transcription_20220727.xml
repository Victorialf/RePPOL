            <p xml:lang="fr">Notre projet est consacré à la transcription, l’édition critique et
					l’analyse d’un document exceptionnel : le manuscrit MS 128 conservé à la
					bibliothèque de Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (à voir sur la <ref target="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/project/31">plateforme TACT</ref>). Il
					s’agit d’un manuscrit composite d’environ 220 folios qui contient la
					documentation rassemblée en 1543 sous l’égide de l’Archevêque de Cantorbéry,
					Thomas Cranmer. Celui-ci, gagné aux idées réformées, est visé par un complot
					ourdi par des chanoines de sa propre cathédrale (d’où le surnom de Prebendaries
					Plot) en lien avec des prêtres et des laïcs « conservateurs » du diocèse du
					Kent. Ces derniers initient un travail de collecte de dénonciations attestant de
					la radicalité religieuse de Cranmer et de certains de ses clients réformés afin
					de discréditer l’archevêque de Cantorbéry aux yeux du roi et précipiter sa
					chute. Cependant, le roi maintient sa faveur à Cranmer mais le charge d’enquêter
					sur toutes les croyances ou pratiques non conformistes dans son diocèse.
					L’objectif de cette vaste enquête est encore à élucider. L’archevêque semble
					saisir cette occasion pour incriminer les clercs et les laïcs conservateurs qui
					ont participé au Prebendaries Plot : ses agents collectent dénonciations et
					témoignages de croyances ou pratiques « superstitieuses » ou « papistes » ;
					mais, le manuscrit renferme également des dénonciations de sacramentaires,
					d’iconoclastes et d’évangéliques radicaux, qui auraient davantage pu susciter
					l’indulgence de Cranmer.</p>
            <p xml:lang="fr">Dès lors, le manuscrit MS 128, fruits de ces collectes
					antinomiques, est une mosaïque double. Mosaïque de documents d’abord, puisqu’il
					comporte des lettres de dénonciations, des interrogatoires ou encore des
					mémorandums dont le sens nous échappe en partie ; mais il est aussi une mosaïque
					de traces des croyances et des pratiques religieuses dans un comté anglais des
					années 1540. En effet, il renferme plus d’une centaine de témoignages ou
					dénonciations émanant de clercs et de laïcs des deux sexes et de tout rang.
					Cette documentation fragmentée révèle l’éclectisme des croyances et des
					pratiques dans cette Angleterre qui a rompu avec Rome depuis près de dix ans et
					dans laquelle Henri VIII peine à imposer une quelconque uniformité malgré
					l’instauration de la Suprématie royale. Ce manuscrit serait-il la trace
					archivistique des tentatives royales (et de leurs limites) d’imposer une «
					uniformité religieuse » désirée par Henri VIII depuis le début des années 1530
					?</p>
            <p xml:lang="fr">Jusqu’à présent, plusieurs historiens ont mobilisé partiellement
					cette source dans le contexte d’études plus larges (Ethan Shagan afin d’explorer
					l’avancée de la Réforme en Angleterre, Diarmaid MacCulloch pour dresser les
					portraits des détracteurs de Thomas Cranmer dans la biographie qu’il lui
					consacre…), mais aucune étude du manuscrit per se n’a été menée et on ne l’a
					jamais fait dialoguer avec des documents proches (interrogatoires,
					dénonciations…) pour en dégager les éclairages politiques, religieux ou sociaux
					qu’il peut apporter sur la période.</p>
            <p xml:lang="fr">Or, le projet RePPOL entend montrer que cette source exceptionnelle
					permet non seulement d’éclairer les croyances et les pratiques liturgiques
					populaires souvent inattendues, parfois cocasses, dans un Kent en « transition
					confessionnelle », mais aussi de saisir la Réforme anglaise comme un phénomène
					de transformation anthropologique du rapport au religieux, processus qui s’étend
					sur des plusieurs décennies du XVIe siècle. RePPOL s’inscrit enfin dans le cadre
					des renouvellements historiographiques récents sur le rôle du peuple dans la
					production du politique à l’époque moderne, ces témoignages permettant de
					comprendre le rôle actif que les sujets, y compris les laïcs les plus infimes,
					ont pu jouer dans les processus de mutations politico-religieuses que connaît
					l’Angleterre henricienne.</p>

            <p>Adoptant une démarche de recherche collaborative et de formation par la
					recherche, ce projet s'articule en trois temps. La première étape (fin juin
					2021-début 2022) vise à transcrire l'intégralité du manuscrit, par une démarche
					collaborative mobilisant enseignants-chercheurs et étudiants dans le cadre du
					cours de paléographie moderne. La transcription semi-diplomatique est réalisé
					via la <ref target="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/">plateforme de Transcription et
						d'Annotations de Corpus Textuel (TACT)</ref> développée par l'Université de
					Grenoble. Les images des folios ont été numérisées par la <ref target="https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/ps908cx9813">Parker
						Library</ref> et y étaient accessibles selon le cadre interopérable <ref target="https://iiif.io/">International Image Interoperability Framework
						(3IF)</ref>. La seconde étape du travail (2022) est consacrée à l'analyse
					fine de cette source à la lumière de documents archivistiques de nature
					similaire. La troisième étape, dont le présent document est l'une des
					incarnations, est la constitution d'une édition numérique en ligne permettant
					via balisage en xml-tei l'interrogation du contenu du document par des
					index.</p>

            <p xml:lang="en">Our project is devoted to the transcription, critical edition, and
					analysis of an exceptional document: the manuscript MS 128 held in the library
					of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (can be viewed on the <ref target="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/project/31">TACT platform</ref>). It is
					a composite manuscript of about 220 folios that contains the documentation
					gathered in 1543 under the supervision of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas
					Cranmer. The latter, won over to the Reformed ideas, was the target of a plot
					hatched by canons of his own cathedral (hence the nickname of the Prebendaries
					Plot) in connection with priests and "conservative" laymen of the diocese of
					Kent. The latter initiated a work of collecting denunciations attesting to the
					religious radicalism of Cranmer and some of his reformed clients in order to
					discredit the archbishop of Canterbury in the eyes of the king and precipitate
					his fall. However, the king maintained his favor to Cranmer but charged him with
					investigating all non-conformist beliefs or practices in his diocese. The
					purpose of this vast investigation is yet to be clarified. The archbishop seemed
					to take the opportunity to incriminate conservative clerics and laymen who had
					participated in the Prebendaries Plot: his agents collected denunciations and
					testimonies of "superstitious" or "papist" beliefs or practices; but the
					manuscript also contained denunciations of sacramentarians, iconoclasts and
					radical evangelicals, which might have been more likely to elicit Cranmer's
					leniency.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The manuscript MS 128, fruit of these antinomic collections, is a
					double mosaic. A mosaic of documents, since it contains letters of denunciation,
					interrogations and memoranda whose meaning partly escapes us; but it is also a
					mosaic of traces of religious beliefs and practices in an English county in the
					1540's. Indeed, it contains more than a hundred testimonies or denunciations
					emanating from clerics and laymen of both sexes and of all ranks. This
					fragmented documentation reveals the eclecticism of beliefs and practices in an
					England that broke with Rome nearly ten years ago and in which Henry VIII
					struggled to impose any kind of uniformity despite the establishment of the
					Royal Supremacy. Could this manuscript be the archival trace of the royal
					attempts (and their limits) to impose a "religious uniformity" desired by Henry
					VIII since the early 1530s ?</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Several historians have partially mobilized this source in the
					context of broader studies (Ethan Shagan in order to explore the progress of the
					Reformation in England, Diarmaid MacCulloch in order to draw up portraits of
					Thomas Cranmer's detractors in his biography of him... ), but no study of the
					manuscript per se has been carried out and it has never been put in dialogue
					with related documents (interrogations, denunciations...) in order to bring out
					the political, religious or social insights that it can bring to the period.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">The RePPOL project intends to show that this exceptional source not
					only sheds light on the often unexpected, sometimes comical, popular beliefs and
					liturgical practices in a Kent undergoing a "confessional transition", but also
					to grasp the English Reformation as a phenomenon of anthropological
					transformation of the relationship to religion, a process that extends over
					several decades of the sixteenth century. Finally, RePPOL is part of the recent
					historiographic renewal on the role of the people in the production of politics
					in the modern era, as these testimonies allow us to understand the active role
					that subjects, including the most minute laymen, were able to play in the
					processes of political and religious mutations that Henrician England
					experienced.</p>
            <p xml:lang="en">Adopting a collaborative and training-through-research approach,
					this project is articulated in three stages. The first stage (end of June
					2021-beginning of 2022) aims to transcribe the entire manuscript, through a
					collaborative approach mobilizing teacher-researchers and students in the
					context of the modern paleography course. The semi-diplomatic transcription is
					carried out via the <ref target="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/">Transcription and
						Annotation Platform for Textual Corpus (TACT)</ref> developed by the
					University of Grenoble. The images of the folios were digitized by the <ref target="https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/ps908cx9813">Parker
						Library</ref> and were accessible there according to the <ref target="https://iiif.io/">International Image Interoperability Framework
						(3IF)</ref>. The second stage of the work (2022) is devoted to fine-grained
					analysis of this source in light of archival records of a similar nature. The
					third step, of which the present document is one of the incarnations, is the
					constitution of an online digital edition allowing via xml-tei tagging the
					interrogation of the document content by indexes.</p>

   				<p>Serles.The 26th of August last past in the Chapter house. (fn. 11) There be some sins that cannot be forgiven but by fasting and prayer. (fn. 11) Good people, you have been deceived with preachers, but if you have received any poison and learned any false doctrine, and believed by ignorance, you be not to blame, neither God is discontent with you. (fn. 11) "In hell is burning of brimstone, wildfire, gunpowder, sudden heat, sudden cold, and we may be sure thereof because that David, Moses, and the prophets which taught us those things, were in the pains of hell, or in a kind of hell, which is Limbo."In margin : "At Ashforth, 12 Augusti, 1543." At Layname. In the house of Mary or Martha He found a certain man very sick, and sore diseased, whose name was Lazarus, brother to these 2 virgins. Magdalen was a fair fingered gentlewoman. (fn. 11) "Christ said to Martha, Thy busyness shall have an end, but thy sister's busyness shall last and never have end."In margin : "Religion." ii. Sandwich alias Gardiner in sermon in Christ's Church the 3d Sunday after Twelfth day. (fn. 11) "The people have not had hitherto the good wine of God's word, but a day would come that they should have good wine again. But, good people, be content; for nondum venit hora, the time is not yet come that you should have good wine."In margin : "Seditious." (fn. 11) "Of late days you have had here so many waterlaggers, which have turned your good wine into water that you could have no good doctrine taught ne preached unto you but the phantasies of their own brains." Margin : "Slanderous."</p>

Margin : "Seditious." The next Sunday after. (fn. 11) "I did prove by Ezechiel, Hieremy, St. Paul and Origen that an image was none idol." Margin : Images. (fn. 11) "You are grieved with me because I called them waterlaggers which have changed our good wine into water. Truly I could invent no fitter name for them; but even as I said then, so I say again. I beshrew their hearts for me. They are come hither and have corrupt our good wine. I would they would get them home again thither from whence they came. But they must be smoked and purged round about with fire, or else we shall never be rid of them." Margin : "Seditious." (fn. 11) "Some of you thought that some should have been hanged, but if you had deserved no more to be burned than they have to be hanged you should both do well enough." Margin : "Seditious." "Prima qure fo. sequente." iii. Shether, 23 Aprilis, in the Chapter house. (fn. 11) "Nowadays, good Christians, they teach nothing but carnal liberty, no man doth teach you the Commandments of God; no man doth preach unto you God's laws; yea, no man dare do it, or rather will not." Margin : "Slanderous." 15 Maii, at St. Stevyns.

   					(fn. 11) Upon this text, 'You must pray without intermission,' he said 'Some fellows say that this is impossible, but I shall tell you, good Christians, how to perform this. It is a common saying in the law, That a man doth by his proctor he doth it by himself. Wherefore, when thou art in the field at thy labour or otherwise occupied, hire the Church to pray for thee (the Church he called the priests) and so shalt thou continually pray.' (fn. 11) He counselled laboring men to divide their labor into 3 parts; to give one penny to the poor, another to the priests to pray for them, and the third to keep for themselves and their households. (fn. 11) He did discourage men from praying in the mother tongue, saying 'Some of you say that men cannot pray in an unknown tongue because they understand not what they say. But I say that no man understandeth what he prayeth, as St. Paul saith, Nescit homo quomodo orandum sit, sed spiritus hominis docet quomodo orandum sit. And therefore, though you do not understand what you pray, yet pray so still.' 16 Septembris in the Chapter house. (fn. 11) "All the constitutions decrees and ordinances of our Holy Mother the Church are most godly, most holy, and therefore are to be observed of all her children, Christian people, without disputing or reasoning of any of them."

Sandwich before Candlemas was 12 month. (fn. 11) "He made 2 very seditious sermons in the Chapter house, calling the preachers that were lately come hither waterlaggers, and that they had taken away God's word from them, and that they should never be rid of them till they purged them with smoke and fire." Margin : "Slanderous." (fn. 11) "Upon Easter last past he did again inveigh against preachers, beating into the people's heads that some had called Our Lady a saffron bag, and that they would Our Lady to have no honor, and that some did take upon them to minister which were no priests, and that some did utterly deny absolution; and then he made such exclamations, crying out 'Heretics ! Faggots ! Fire !' as though these things had been committed here indeed. D. Thornden." (fn. 13) Margin : "Slanderous."

"He hath not in his own person preached in his church at Ashford against the usurpation of the Bishop of Rome, and set out the King's Majesty's supremacy according to his Majesty's letters, injunctions and proclamations; neither hath he declared to his parish the difference between ceremonies and works commanded by God; neither hath he showed the right use of the said ceremonies and the superstitions used heretofore by them, according to the said letters, injunctions and proclamations."

In margin are the following names (of course witnesses) : "Tho. Hawkins, Tho. Porrich, Raynolde Smith, Sir John Legate, and the vicar of Boughton." xvi. Thomas Gymlot alias Barbour. The parish of Buckland complaineth that he, being a layman, hath the vicarage there given unto him under the King's broad seal, and he causeth not the cure to be served as of right appertaineth, but they be fain of their own charges to find a curate.</p>

Margin : "The Bishop of Rome." xxi. The Parson of Riple. (fn. 11) "He said openly in his parish 'I am commanded to show you the paternoster in English; you may do as you will in learning of it, but it is against mine opinion.

Margin : "Injunctions." xxvii. The Parson of Milton besides Canterbury.

Of that, said he, I spake last time that I preached, and showed you that we must return where we went out.

At Leneham on the feast of Assumption of Our Lady last he said, as the moon was full at 14 days, even so Mary was conceived fully with Christ when she was 14 years old; also, that if one had looked in Mary when she was full conceived with Christ he should have perceived him in his mother's womb with a bush of thorns on his back; that Mary bore Christ poorly for she had no fire, but begged a coal of one and a stick of another to warm her child; that she nourished her son with milk, not material milk but milk that came from heaven; for no woman can nourish her child with material milk but she that is conceived by knowledge of man; </p></div>

(Note by Cranmer : "Bradkirke priest, Mr. Shether, John Marden, Rob. Colman; these four be witness against all the articles of Ridley and Scory in the first detection made to me 2 years past.")

   			<div><p>"He preached at Faversham in festo Dedicationis ecclesie Anno 1542 that the dedications of material churches was instituted for the Bishops' profits, and that he could not see by Scripture that they might use any such fashions for that purpose; for they use conjurations and then they must conjure the Devil out of the ground, or out of the lime and stone; and if so, then it were as well necessary for every man's house to be consecrate or dedicate. Item, admit, quod he, that the dedication of the same were lawful, yet the Bishops should always preach, for that is their office, and other men might and may consecrate them as well as they. Item, he said This sumptuous adorning of churches is against the old fashion of the primitive Church. They had no such copes or chalices nor other jewels, nor gildings, nor paintings of images as we now have, and therefore if I were curate I would sell all such things, or lay them to pledge to help the poor."

He has also refused to bear his candle and palm at the times approved by the King; which has occasioned much murmuring. He and Wm. Morris pulled down sundry images in St. Clement's church. 21 Sept. 1543.Bland, in a sermon at Faversham the 23d Sunday after Trin., said the mass was no satisfaction for sin but only a remembrance of Christ's passion. </p>

   				<p>He said that the sight of the image of St. Michael with the balance was enough to bring a man to the Devil; that no man may pray to saints for anything; that particular confession was not necessary; that to kneel or bow to a cross, yea, though it were the very cross that Christ died on, was idolatry; that bps. did make priests for money, yea though they could scantly read, and he knew it to be so; that setting up candles before the Sacrament was superstitious. He preached in Lynsted ch. on St. Matthues day, 1542, that auricular confession was not scriptural, nor in the law of God. "I marvel, quod he, why it is used in the Church; also, quod he, it hath been often put down." </p>

   				<p>He said in a sermon at Staple on Mary Magdalen's day : "John Baptist had his head smitten off for speaking of the truth; and so, nowadays, for speaking of the truth, many have their heads broken." He said he was no changeling but would abide by what he said. He said in his ch. of Addisham (Cr. has written "Staple" over) 18 March, 1542, that if the people knew what abominable words are said in the hallowing of palms, they would not bear them; also, that he had commandment of certain of the Council to set forth such things; that he could not find in his conscience to say or sing Ave Rex before the rood, for it was plain idolatry; that the image of the Trinity is not to be suffered and he cannot find Trinitas throughout Scripture, but that Athanasius put it in his Symbolum; that it is not consonant to the law of God that we should cry or call to Saints, or sing or say the litany before the hallowing of the font, "nor other times, ne no procession commanded."</p>

   				<p>In the mass book is plain detestable heresies, and in the mass also. God is not pleased with lights before the Sacraments. In a sermon made at Boughton under the Bleane, 18 April 1541, he said the mass did not profit for sins, else Christ had died in vain. On 4 Feb. last he preached "that auricular confession was the most abomination that could be." On St. Stephen's day, 34 H. VIII. he said in the parish of Northgate, Canterbury, "that if women did understand what was read and sung in the matins, mass and evensong, they would be ashamed one of another; for there was in it both heresy and treason." He said on Candlemas day last at St. John's a' Cant' "that if the people knew what the words were that the priest sayeth when he layeth his hand upon your heads after your confession, you would be ashamed to hear them, for it is an abomination to speak them. And I would think myself the worse, quod he, a month after, to speak </p>

In Northgate parish he said "If you knew what abominations are in the words of absolution which the priest sayeth over you when you be shriven, you would abhor them;" also "that in the christening of children priests be murderers." 26 Sept. 1543.John Boucher of Fretynden said "that matins and evensong was no better than rumbling of tubs"; also that mass and dirige were not laudable. Cr. : "Offensive." Clerk of Hedcorn has books of Tyndall and Frith. 21 Sept. 1543.Jo. Toftes is noted as a common maintainer and harbourer of persons accused of heresies, </p>

His house has been the resort of Bland, Tournour, the parson of Hothefild, "Jonas the priest, that was married to a man's daughter of Barham at St. John's Hospital, and after commonly resorted to Toftes' house."

He commanded the curates to warn their parishioners to carry no holy water home to their houses; and that they should bless no person departing this life with the holy candle.

He wished absolution deferred till Easter to persons who could not say the Paternoster and Creed in English, and then given with their communion. He asked, where will you find auricular confession in Scripture? And being reminded of those who came to John the Baptist confessing their sins, pointed out that that was public. He commanded that the curates and people should go on procession in harvest time only on holy days. Sir Jas. Newnam, a priest of Chartham, in his Confiteor refused to rehearse the name of Our Lady, and he said it was against his conscience to cense the crucifix; "which things presented by the churchwardens to Mr. Commissary was never punished." When told that Jo. Clerke and Joan Bowcher had eaten a calf's head on Easter day in the morning, Mr. Commissary answered "If they have broken their fast to-day let them have their rights to-morrow." </p>

   				<p>He pulled down the images in Northgate ch., and had home to his house the pictures of Our Lady with the tabernacle, and hewed her all in pieces, with other pictures of the Apostles. He commanded Anth. Persons to read and expound the Bible on Palm Sunday in All Hallows' ch. Canterbury; which when the parson refused, he brought a token from Mr. Commissary so to do; "whereby he did read, and it is said that by sufferance of him and such other evil persons, hath caused such mischief in this diocese." He caused images to be hewn in pieces at Ashford and compelled the curate to say he did it. He cast the parson of Pevyngton's beads into the fire in derision and gave him a penny for them. "Dr. Nevinson in Lent was 12 month rebuked one Sir John Write, priest dwelling in St. Alpheis, because he would not absolve Bartylmew Joye without any confession made of any crime or fault." Raynold Buckemer of Boxley taken before Sir Chr. Halles, knt., at Maidstone 32 H.

Then said Mr. Comissary, Be you all able to prove that you have spoken? And so caused me with many other worshipful folk to justify. Then said I, Sir, [her] own confession is in your registry. Then Mr. Commissary made answer and said, I have inquired for them, but I cannot find them. But I will look them out, for shorting of the matter." On Palm week next after, Mr. Commissary calling forth many of his witnesses sent for me to examine me. "I said, Sir, I marvel why ye do thus trouble yourself and other. If ye had sent to your officer for her confession ye should need no other business. Then said he, I have done so, but I cannot find them. Then I made him answer, Sir, it is not so; for within these 2 days they were forthcoming. Then said Mr. Commissary, Can you fetch them? And I made answer, No, I think Mr. Draper will not deliver them unto me. But if it please you to send your servant with me I am sure he will deliver them." And so he sent his servant with me and I brought them. And, as soon as he had read them, he discharged 5 or mo of their examination; and, as all we took it, which were or should have been examined, if our tales had not been according, it had been for her discharge and to our high rebuke. Then next court day appointed for that matter, he declared her to be an heretic, both by her confession and also by witness; which thing she utterly denied. But then, said he, you cannot deny it, but said to her </p>

I advise you to stick to it. Then did she bring forth the King's pardon which was given to the Anabaptists for their deliverance (fn. 31), repenting themselves. Which pardon, what else it contained, be it in your judgment. Also, at that time Toftes the elder stood in the Consistory there pleading her cause for her defence, where before he never was proctor in that court, nother sythe. Also, at that time came forth to the Court the parson of Westbere with 2 honest men of the parish, that said that they heard her husband say that she was abjured at Colchester. Then said Mr. Commissary Do you know it for truth that she was abjured? No, said they, but thus said her husband. Then said Mr. Commissary, I take you for no witness in this point, and so delivered her, she requiring no pardon, nor confessing her offence why the pardon should be ministered to her. Witness to this John Milles, priest. Also, there was one Jonas was married at St. John's house without Northgate to the daughter of one Marsh of Barham, he being a priest, as the voice went, but the truth is, she is married unto another, and Jonas stale away. Also, one Mr. Store ("Scory" by Cr. in margin) preached in St. Elphis church upon Ascension day was 12 month saying, Ye have a saying, the child which is born between man and wife, it is born in original </p>

But look how that the wife that occupieth the fire all the day and at night covereth it with ashes to preserve the fire; so doth the sin remain under the Sacrament. Also, Anthony Parson read a lecture upon Palm Sunday last past saying it was the office of the Father of Heaven to make Heaven and Earth and all that is in them. Also, he said that it was the office of the Second Person to die by his Passion to redeem man. "Also, it was the office of the Holy Ghost to give wit and knowledge to the Apostles." ["The same Sunday Thos. Makebley, barber, sat in the church all the procession time and bore no palm nor would follow the procession.] (fn. 30) Also, upon Easter day following, at the Resurrection, followed not the procession as all other people did." </p>

   				<p>Thos. Dawby, now parson of Wycheling, sometime curate of Leneham, many times procured persons of Leneham and other parishes "to read the Bible, even at the choir door where divine service was sung or said, from the beginning of the service to the ending, with as low a voice as they could." He went into the pulpit incontinent with the King's injunctions, and expounded them that it was lawful for all manner of men to read the Bible at all times and that no one ought to discourage them. "And said if singing and playing were to God's honor as men would have it seem to be, think you that our Prince would have pulled down these abbeys as he hath done?" Also that all men from the highest to the lowest, were not only free to marry, but were bound to marry rather than to burn. Also (1542 about Christmas) that Christ's Passion is alone sufficient for all our sins, partly despising good works and penance, when he had occasion to speak of them; and that good works were no part of our salvation. Also (1539) that Our Lady was no better than another woman, and that "she was but a sack to put Christ in." He took down eight or more images in the said church "that never were abused by any pilgrimage," contrary to the King's injunction. He induced Sir John Abbey, now curate of Leneham, "to take the key of the church door secretly from the sexton's house and to go privily into the church, and take down one image more of Our Lady Pity, and brake her in pieces; which is the fairest image in the church and never abused." </p>

   				<p>He did his best when curate of Leneham to persuade the parish to have taken down all the images in the church, and said they were directly against God's commandment. He caused divers to break their fast that were disposed to keep it, saying all days were alike (1539). He said "Such a day, you shall have Our Lady, as for the Even you may fast that listeth." He would never say De profundis (1542), declaring that the service in the church is but baggage, "and always he rebelled against them that used to say their service and such as bere any portis about them." He called the chrismatory a juggling box and a priest's crown Balaam's mark (1540). He asked an honest man why he made reverence when he came before the Sacrament. In the Rogation days he would neither sing nor say any Gospel in Latin, nor have any holy water carried with him, nor would sing nor say any part of the litany or call on any Saint while he was curate, which was for one year and more. He said at Sittingborne, 4 August 34 Hen. VIII., to one Alex. Plott who had observed to him "Images stand in our church," "Your curate is more knave." "Why do they stand in Cranebroke, then? said Alexander Plotte, seeing that there dwelleth worshipful men, the King's justices, and, as I think, some of them be of the King's Council? And by that they are now building of a goodly roodloft." "They are," said the parson, "pope-holy knaves and I would that the roodloft were money in my purse." The said Alexander also asked him whether we should pay tithes for "podeware," i.e. pease and tares, saying "Our horses eateth all in winter." He replied "Ye should pay none. The King hath made a law that ye shall pay, but it is contrary to God's law that ye should pay any tithe for them." </p>

   				<p>One said "The King's Grace hath done a godly deed in making this worshipful college at Canterbury; for there is many well learned men now and many good clerks shall be brought up there." "He hath made," said the parson of Wytchelyng, "a very den of thieves." He also hoped to see the time when there should be set no taper before the Sepulture. Jas. Wourley's wife said (29 May) that good prayers and deeds should save her from the Devil. "Not so," said the parson of Wytchelyng; "thou shalt not be saved by thy deeds but only by faith;" and further to Sir Thomas Huxley "That knave thy master, the parson of Bocton, is a false heretic and a popish knave and thou also. And I shall make forty in the parish of Dodington to bark at thee, and I shall make 10,000 of my set against thee in Kent, and those shalt not tarry here this month." Also "he said the Ave Maria was never made by God, for part of it was made by a priest's harlot." Added by Cr. : "Item, he called the book lately set forth by the King and his clergy a crafty book." Sir Rauf said in the pulpit (1539) in the ch. of Leneham aforesaid "There be some priests do use to give penance in confession for sin; but I tell you, said he, whosoever giveth penance for sin robbeth God of his honor. I myself have done so, but I cry God mercy. I did it in ignorance." Sir Robert Stotte, curate of Davyngton, on Alhalonday 1541 in the pulpit of Leneham said "there was heresy sung in the church that present day"; also "that our Prince suffered dirges and masses to be said and sung in the church for priests to get money by. And Mr. Serles, vicar of Leneham, came to Leneham and preached, and to our judgment made a good sermon there. And the said Sir Robert, hearing thereof, came from Davington to Leneham the Sunday following; and after evensong the same day there was an anthem sung of Our Lady, and he said openly in the church </p>

   				<p>that it was heresy. And incontinent he went unto the Bible and turned to the same gospel that Mr. Serls had preached the Sunday next before and expounded the contrary to Mr. Serls in every word with threatening words towards him, saying, All pickpurses' ears are not set on the pillory as yet. Whereupon divers were offended with him and many words were multiplied and great variance amongst the people; insomuch that divers persons thought there should have been a fray. And thus he came 6 or 7 times within half a year and preached half an hour at the least, always moving the people to give no credence to Mr. Serles or Mr. Shether." </p>

"The saying and opinion of Raynold Bucker of Boxley, spoken and obstinately declared by him in the feast of the Assumption of Our Lady or the Sunday after in the 31 years (sic) of the King's Majesty's most noble reign, in the house of John Man of Boxley, in the presence and hearing of the same John Man, John Todde and John Stockwell; which Raynold Buckley was abjured by the lord Warham, late Archbishop of Cant'; which abjuration Mr. Dr. Leef, Master of Maidstone College, can declare more at length." 1. He said that the Sacrament of the Altar was bread like other bread; "and that the knave priests did receive him before noon and did piss and shit him out at whores' arses at afternoon; which accusation was taken before Sir Christopher Hales, knight, deceased, at Maidstone the xxij (sic) year of the King's most noble reign, and in writing delivered to Mr. Nevinson, now Commissary. And afterward by Henry Cloake, then servant to the same Sir Christopher; and also the same Henry Cloke did hear the same words of Buckmer rehearsed by the witness aforesaid, and also declared it to the said Commissary. And afterwards the same Sir Christopher sent for the said Buckmer and the witness to Maidstone by Rauf Johnson his servant; which Rauf delivered the said Buckmer to the Commissary and also the witness; where the Commissary threatened the said John Todd, as he sayeth and will say. And for a while the said Buckmer was in my lord Archbishop's palace, as they said, under ward. But he went at large and did pull hemp. And after the death of the said Sir Christopher, or a little before, the same Buckmer was sent home again unpunished, contrary to the King's laws. And thus bearing and favor with such like hath been courage to other ill doers concerning ill opinions. </p>

Then one Mr. Parson of Allington (fn. 32) said that they would say that they uttered their confession. Then said Mr. Commissary Ubi invenies auricularem confessionem esse de jure divino?

   				<p>Remarque des transcripteurs: In Willoughby's hand XI. A paper headed by Cranmer : "Dr. Willoughby." "My Lord, as concerning the schryne, I had never commandment to pull hit down, and also hit his bot anente thenke (an empty thing); bot Master Thwattes had hit at Sente Astens and gave hit to the cherche." Was commanded to pull down the rood, but could not do it alone; so he went the next morning with the parish priest to some parishioners and showed them the order; and they said the King's book was to the contrary, except where oblations were made to it, "and by and by cassyd (caused) that same artekell to be redde, and then all sayde ther scholde none be pollyd downe ther; and by and by cassyd a loke to be sett of the dore. Part of ther names be thes : Master Pettet, Wylzam Amys, goodman Macstede, holde fader Baker, and alle the holle paryche. And this was of a Sonday in the morning; and the nexte Sonday after, and I ham avyssed, Master Twhattes was mared; and ther Master Pettyt broke the mater to Master Moylle, and he dyd asche wherever ther wor one oblacion ther to or no; and he sayd Nay; and then sayde Master Moylle Then I warrant yow let him stonde." "Also as conserning that ever I preched of ony sante, or thowght one seche thenges I wolde I scholde never come in heven, nor never so ment; hyffe I had I wolde not aplenyd (have complained) to Master Comyssare of that thyng wyche I wolde have mantynde; and as for Colver strette I never saw hit. I have bene here bot iiij yere. How scholde I have Lade Colver (fn. 38) in honde and never harde of hyr of my consyence to this day." </p>

   				<p>Remarques des transcripteurs: In Willoughby's hand, pp. 2. ii. Dr. Willoughby's [first] confession, (fn. 39) containing replies to each of the interrogatories (X.) as numbered, viz. 1, That the first he ever heard of the putting forth of the matter was on Palm Sunday in Dr. London's house, of Serles and him; 2, and it was set forth by Serles only, without any man's knowledge "that I know of, for my coming to London was to speak with the chamberlain of London and his errand to Oxford. 3. Cannot tell by whose counsel or encouragement it was. 4. Cannot tell "what matter they had at the beginning more than he provided for of himself," for I can say nothing against any one but by hearsay. 5. "And whether they were of his own knowledge or by hearsay I cannot tell; but he and Gardener had been gathering of matters a quarter of a year before. I perceived that by the mossyons thay mayde to me for pottyng of them upp." 6. Of things against my lord he knew nothing they minded till he saw it in writing. 7. Nor of their preferment of their articles at the sessions; for he was not in Kent at the time, nor spoke with any justices of peace in this matter, or, 8, with any of them that was privy. At the beginning he told Mr. Moyle and Mr. Thwaytes that Dr. London said the justices would be "shent" for suffering such preaching. </p>

   				<p>9. Knows not "to what things they have conduced unto"; only consented "to bear the name of putting up of these matters which Serlys did, and that I said it was I, here in the country in many places, lying upon myself like a fool, and yet never came before the Council, nor never minded but to avoid the suspicion; I made much babbling and much noise, bringing myself in great slander, and nothing so. And for this doing I submit myself to God and my lord's grace. 10. Never reasoned with Pettyd or any other lawyer touching indictments or any such matter "be my fathe." (fn. 40) 11. Knows not what effect they intended to bring this matter to. Most likely, to subdue his Grace's (the Abp's.) power. They hoped to have had other commissioners than his Lordship, for so Dr. London promised them. 12. As concerning their authority, suspects they took it of Dr. London's presumption, seeing him go forward against such men of worship. (fn. 41)"Thenkyng oder scholde acome to the same, I ferde Master Torner and the Vecar of Hosprenge my selffe, ther was so many schamfull maters lade against them." As to the Vicar of Charing, never drank in his house nor came there since your Grace's household did lie there; nor ever heard of this matter before. Was too foolish and too full of words to be of their counsel, and so they said.</p>
