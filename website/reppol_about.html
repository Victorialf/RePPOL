         <section>
            <p>Our project is devoted to the transcription, critical edition, and analysis of an
               exceptional document: the manuscript MS 128 held in the library of Corpus Christi
               College, Cambridge (can be viewed on the <a href="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/project/31" target="blanck">TACT platform</a>). It is a composite manuscript of about 220 folios that contains the documentation
               gathered in 1543 under the supervision of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer.
               The latter, won over to the Reformed ideas, was the target of a plot hatched by canons
               of his own cathedral (hence the nickname of the Prebendaries Plot) in connection with
               priests and "conservative" laymen of the diocese of Kent. The latter initiated a work
               of collecting denunciations attesting to the religious radicalism of Cranmer and some
               of his reformed clients in order to discredit the archbishop of Canterbury in the
               eyes of the king and precipitate his fall. However, the king maintained his favor
               to Cranmer but charged him with investigating all non-conformist beliefs or practices
               in his diocese. The purpose of this vast investigation is yet to be clarified. The
               archbishop seemed to take the opportunity to incriminate conservative clerics and
               laymen who had participated in the Prebendaries Plot: his agents collected denunciations
               and testimonies of "superstitious" or "papist" beliefs or practices; but the manuscript
               also contained denunciations of sacramentarians, iconoclasts and radical evangelicals,
               which might have been more likely to elicit Cranmer's leniency.</p>
            <p>The manuscript MS 128, fruit of these antinomic collections, is a double mosaic. A
               mosaic of documents, since it contains letters of denunciation, interrogations and
               memoranda whose meaning partly escapes us; but it is also a mosaic of traces of religious
               beliefs and practices in an English county in the 1540's. Indeed, it contains more
               than a hundred testimonies or denunciations emanating from clerics and laymen of both
               sexes and of all ranks. This fragmented documentation reveals the eclecticism of beliefs
               and practices in an England that broke with Rome nearly ten years ago and in which
               Henry VIII struggled to impose any kind of uniformity despite the establishment of
               the Royal Supremacy. Could this manuscript be the archival trace of the royal attempts
               (and their limits) to impose a "religious uniformity" desired by Henry VIII since
               the early 1530s ?</p>
            <p>Several historians have partially mobilized this source in the context of broader
               studies (Ethan Shagan in order to explore the progress of the Reformation in England,
               Diarmaid MacCulloch in order to draw up portraits of Thomas Cranmer's detractors in
               his biography of him... ), but no study of the manuscript per se has been carried
               out and it has never been put in dialogue with related documents (interrogations,
               denunciations...) in order to bring out the political, religious or social insights
               that it can bring to the period.</p>
            <p>The RePPOL project intends to show that this exceptional source not only sheds light
               on the often unexpected, sometimes comical, popular beliefs and liturgical practices
               in a Kent undergoing a "confessional transition", but also to grasp the English Reformation
               as a phenomenon of anthropological transformation of the relationship to religion,
               a process that extends over several decades of the sixteenth century. Finally, RePPOL
               is part of the recent historiographic renewal on the role of the people in the production
               of politics in the modern era, as these testimonies allow us to understand the active
               role that subjects, including the most minute laymen, were able to play in the processes
               of political and religious mutations that Henrician England experienced.</p>
            <p>Adopting a collaborative and training-through-research approach, this project is articulated
               in three stages. The first stage (end of June 2021-beginning of 2022) aims to transcribe
               the entire manuscript, through a collaborative approach mobilizing teacher-researchers
               and students in the context of the modern paleography course. The semi-diplomatic
               transcription is carried out via the <a href="https://tact.demarre-shs.fr/" target="blanck">Transcription and Annotation Platform for Textual Corpus (TACT)</a> developed by the University of Grenoble. The images of the folios were digitized
               by the <a href="https://parker.stanford.edu/parker/catalog/ps908cx9813" target="blanck">Parker Library</a> and were accessible there according to the <a href="https://iiif.io/" target="blanck">International Image Interoperability Framework (3IF)</a>. The second stage of the work (2022) is devoted to fine-grained analysis of this
               source in light of archival records of a similar nature. The third step, of which
               the present document is one of the incarnations, is the constitution of an online
               digital edition allowing via xml-tei tagging the interrogation of the document content
               by indexes.</p>
