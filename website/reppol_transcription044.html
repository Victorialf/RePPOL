                        						the Passion of Christ has as much free will as Adam had in Paradise (Cr.
                        						"Error"); also that the new preachers with the liberty of the Gospel have
                        						caused our living to be worse than the Turks; that Zachary and Elizabeth his
                        						wife kept all the commandments, and that it was a light thing for every man
                        						to keep them if he would; that if a man sinned after baptism he must
                        						purchase remission by penance like Mary Magdalen; also of a king that had a
                        						leprosy and had a vision to go to Jordan to wash and be made whole; but in

                        						was made whole. He compared a man's conscience to a dog, and said "Beware of
                        						these false preachers, which preach to you new fangells. Will you know how
                        						to discern a true preacher from a false? You have a dog, which is your
                        						conscience. Whensoever you shall come to any sermon ask your dog what he
                        						saith unto it. If he say it be good, then follow it; but if your dog bark
                        						against it and say that it is naught,</p>
